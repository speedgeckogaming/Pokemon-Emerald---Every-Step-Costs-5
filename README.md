# Pokemon-Emerald---Every-Step-Costs-5
This is my patch for Pokemon Emerald, where every step you take in the game reduces your money by $5.


To set up the patch, you'll need a base (unmodified) ROM of Pokemon Emerald. You can get this from somewhere like Vimm's Lair, Archive.org, etc.
When you have your base ROM ready, you can go to "https://www.romhacking.net/patch/" or any other patcher of your choice, and place your base (unmodified) copy of emerald into the "ROM file" slot. Then, place my patch (either the .ips, .bps, or .ups file should all work).
Then click "Apply patch", and a new patched copy of Emerald will download, that will have the mods in place.

Enjoy! :)
